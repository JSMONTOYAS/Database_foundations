<h1>Project Description</h1>
For the project proposal, we aim to develop an application that serves as a
distributor and hub for purchasing and downloading purely digital apps and products,
all within an interface where each user has access to the catalog of applications
along with their respective reviews and statistics within the app.
Likewise, every user possesses the capability to publish their own applications and
manage their distribution, setting prices and regional visibility according to their
needs. In light of this, we propose a business model wherein each user who
publishes an app will pay a commission for sales and distribution to the application
for every copy sold of the product, or alternatively, a percentage of the total profits
generated if the application is free to download. If the user prefers, this percentage
will vary based on the net value of the revenue produced by the application in its last
year of publication available in the sales and distribution app.
